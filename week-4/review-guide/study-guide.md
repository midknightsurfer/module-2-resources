# Week 4 Study Guide

## About the test:

- time: 3 hours
- 14 MC questions
- 13 Coding Specs
- 21/27 points to pass
- Resources Allowed:
  Code you wrote yourself
  AA Open
  VSCode
  Console
  MDN Documentation
  Chai and Mocha Documentation

## What to study for multiple choice:

- Difference between static and instance methods (when to use and what they are called on)
- Types of Errors you may see in JavaScript code and what would cause them to be thrown
- How to make a child class and how it differs in syntax from its parent
- Explain polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance and how they contribute to OOP
- Explain both DRY coding and coding that meets the principle of SRP
- Be able to explain what makes arrow functions special and where they may cause problems
- Explain context and identify the keyword that represents an object's context
- Be able to identify key ideas of OOP
- Be able to look at a block of test code and describe the best description of the function it tests
- Explain the benefits of TDD
- Be able to identify when bind, call or apply may correct an error in code

## What to study/practice for coding problem:

- Reading specs and writing code based on the test code
- Writing parent and child classes, including their constructors and setting up instance variables, both ones that are immediately/default set upon instantiation and those created by passing in variables in the constructor.
- importing and exporting modules using module.exports (HINT!!: pay attention to how files are pulled into the spec file to tell you how to export them)
- writing instance methods that access properties of instances of a class within another class
- using instanceof to see if something is a child of a parent class
- throwing errors if a condition is not met
