# Test Information:

- 3 hours for test - total of 31 points (passing is 24) 
- 14 Multiple Choice Questions 
- 2 coding problems: 
    - 6 specs on first one 
    - 11 specs on the second



# Resources allowed For this assessment, you may use the following resources:

- MDN 
- open.appacademy.io 
- code you've written yourself 
- VSCode 
- Console


# Topics to know for multiple choice: 
- BigO of operations with Single and Double
Linked Lists

- Describe an indexed location in memory

- Understand the functionality of methods on Lists, Stacks and Queues

- Be able to convert characters from Binary to ASCII, Hexadecimal, base10 and
back.

- Be able to look at a piece of code and determine the BigO time complexity.

- BigO time complexity of methods on a dynamic array

- Know when hash table collisions occur

- Know how many bits make up various sizes of memory

- Know the BigO time complexity of operations in a hash table

- Be able to read a truth table and give outcomes of values

- Know the space complexities of the data structures learned this week

- Know the properties of an array


# Things to know for coding portion: 
- implement a queue or a linked list (you should have an implementation you wrote this 
week that you can use)
- identify cases of O(n) complexity and be able to optimize to O(1) 
by using data structures (sets, queues, linked lists) other than 
arrays and the corresponding methods to access or add elements
    - make sure you know the properties of each 
- be able to convert hexadecimal to ascii characters and return strings
