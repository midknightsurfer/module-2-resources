# What to study for Multiple Choice:
    -be able to determine the O(n) of a refactored algorithm
    -be able to describe the features, benefits, complexities and use cases for:
        breadth-first traversal, 
        depth-first traversal, 
        depth-first search and 
        breadth first search

    -be able to give the space and time complexities for the sorting algorithms
    we learned this week (both in-place and out-of-place)
    -be able to describe and/or recognize a binary search tree, binary tree,
    and directed acyclic graph 
    -given a graphic representation of a tree, be able to list out elements in order
    for both depth first and breadth first traversals, as well as in-order, pre-order 
    and post-order
    -be able to identify a correct equation for sorting elements in an array using the 
    built in array.sort() method for ascending and/or descending order
    -be able to describe the behaviors of quick sort, merge sort, selection sort, 
    bubble sort, and insertion sort
    -be able to describe the behavior of a binary search

# What to study for coding portion:
    -be able to implement a social graph similar to the practice assessment
    -be able to implement a breadth first search on a tree
